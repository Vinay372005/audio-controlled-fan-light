# Audio-Controlled Fan/Light System

This project demonstrates an audio-controlled fan/light system using
Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Machine Learning (ML).

Users provide a sound (clap) through a microphone.
Each detected clap toggles the device state (ON/OFF),
which is displayed on a web interface.

Tech Stack:
- Python
- Librosa
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib
## Current Status
- Project structure finalized
- Audio data will be added at final stage
- ML model training pending
